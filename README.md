# Keptn self-monitoring with Dynatrace

This repository contains tutorials and scripts for setting up self-monitoring of [Keptn](https://keptn.sh/) with [Dynatrace](https://www.dynatrace.com/).
At the end of this tutorial, you will have set up Keptn as a project within Keptn, and have its services monitored by Dynatrace. As a result, it will be possible to use the [keptncontrib/dynatrace-sli-service](https://github.com/keptn-contrib/dynatrace-sli-service) to fetch metrics from the Dynatrace API and evaluate them using Keptn's quality-gates feature.

The tutorials and scripts in this repository are based on Keptn v0.8.0, which is currently under development and is prone to change.
